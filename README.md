1. Car Price Prediction :

   Car price prediction is a machine learning project aimed at developing a model to estimate the prices of used cars accurately. By analyzing various attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, and fuel type, the model provides valuable insights for buyers and sellers in the used car market, helping them make informed decisions and strategize their pricing effectively. Through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, this predictive tool offers real-time price estimations for different car configurations, improving the overall transparency and efficiency of the buying and selling process.
